Initial idea:

Basic backend design:
1. First, define a game instance, associated with 2 players. Maybe for now, create "rooms" perhaps?
2. Keep track of whether the player chose white or black.
3. For each game instance, save the current state in a database.
4. As soon as one of the players makes a move, update the state of the game and load it in for the other player.

User auth:
1. Maintain a database of player accounts.
2. Implement authentication.
3. Implement statistics; after each game, update the player's wins/losses/draws etc.

To decide:
1. How do you update the state of game on a per-room basis, privately?
Maybe, you can use the URL for this? Something like /room=<room_name>&user=<username> for each game
(THIS IS BEFORE AUTH IMPLEMENTATION. NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PERFORM AUTHENTICATION LATER.)
2. Randomly generate room_name to give to the player, so that they can share this with another player
to retrieve data from the database.
NOTE: Ensure that no 2 rooms have the same room name and no 2 users can have the same username.
3. After room creation, wait until another player joins the same room. Only then, start a game instance.
4. To do "real-time" updations, maybe I can just ask the server to send me the state of the game once every x ms? (Polling approach)
Or, maybe, for the other player, wait until an update is made and only then fetch. Kind of like sockets. Might be tedious.
5. How to store the state of the game on the database? Need to make a standard.

To-do (apart from the initial to-do I made a week ago):
1. ENCRYPT PASSWORDS!
2. DECIDE GAME STATE, AND HOW IT IS STORED!
3. Possibly allow pre-moves?
4. Perhaps, maintain a Local Multiplayer mode (without login) and an Online Multiplayer mode (with login)?

Tables I can use:
1. Users and their stats - username, password (after some sort of encryption), wins, losses, draws
2. Current Game Instances - room_name, player1_username, player2_username, state of game (TBD)

Latest:

To-Do:
Prevent the same user from being in the same room twice or two different rooms at once.
Later, maybe consider cases where the player might leave in the middle of a game being loaded or something?
Victory tracking -> Done I think? Need to display these stats in the waiting room though.
Implement a timer for when a player leaves after a game has started, and shut down the room and award the remaining player the victory?
Maybe, when player logs out and logs back into the same room, automatically refresh the page? Either this, or make the button say "Continue" instead of "Start Game" at this point.
When last player in a room disconnects, display a message saying that the room was closed.
Implement a chatting feature while the game is going on, and also in the waiting room.
Perhaps create a separate popup based Create Account button? Same goes for Login aswell.
Upon login, if their previous game is running, add them back automatically
Cookies to save username and password
Weird lengthy chessboard glitch. Possibly after abandoning the game and starting a new one on the same account? idk, happened to Nikesh when he left the game window as is and came back to it like 10 mins later

---------------------> For now, I'm going make player1 in the room play White and player2 in the room play Black. <---------------------
