Initial idea:

Basic backend design:
1. First, define a game instance, associated with 2 players. Maybe for now, create "rooms" perhaps?
2. Keep track of whether the player chose white or black.
3. For each game instance, save the current state in a database.
4. As soon as one of the players makes a move, update the state of the game and load it in for the other player.

User auth:
1. Maintain a database of player accounts.
2. Implement authentication.
3. Implement statistics; after each game, update the player's wins/losses/draws etc.

To decide:
1. How do you update the state of game on a per-room basis, privately?
Maybe, you can use the URL for this? Something like /room=<room_name>&user=<username> for each game
(THIS IS BEFORE AUTH IMPLEMENTATION. NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PERFORM AUTHENTICATION LATER.)
2. Randomly generate room_name to give to the player, so that they can share this with another player
to retrieve data from the database.
NOTE: Ensure that no 2 rooms have the same room name and no 2 users can have the same username.
3. After room creation, wait until another player joins the same room. Only then, start a game instance.
4. To do "real-time" updations, maybe I can just ask the server to send me the state of the game once every x ms? (Polling approach)
Or, maybe, for the other player, wait until an update is made and only then fetch. Kind of like sockets. Might be tedious.
5. How to store the state of the game on the database? Need to make a standard.

To-do (apart from the initial to-do I made a week ago):
1. ENCRYPT PASSWORDS!
2. DECIDE GAME STATE, AND HOW IT IS STORED!
3. Possibly allow pre-moves?
4. Perhaps, maintain a Local Multiplayer mode (without login) and an Online Multiplayer mode (with login)?

Tables I can use:
1. Users and their stats - username, password (after some sort of encryption), wins, losses, draws
2. Current Game Instances - room_name, player1_username, player2_username, state of game (TBD)

Latest:

To-Do:
ENCRYPT PASSWORDS!
LOOK AT THE FIRST LINE BELOW auth() TO CLEAR SESSION! DO THAT AFTER YOU IMPLEMENT PROPER LOGOUT.
Prevent the same user from being in the same room twice or two different rooms at once.
Refreshing page should retain state of game as is. Implement this also (just send the state of the game when page is refreshed ig?)
Later, maybe consider cases where the player might leave in the middle of a game being loaded or something?
Victory tracking
Page refresh when chessboard is displayed
Timeout when player leaves perhaps

---------------------> For now, I'm going make player1 in the room White and player2 in the room Black. <---------------------
